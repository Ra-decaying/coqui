Example: Wannier90 MLWF Construction via CoQui (Library Mode)

This example demonstrates how to construct maximally localized Wannier
functions (MLWFs) using CoQui's Python interface to Wannier90 in *library mode*.
In contrast to invoking the standalone `wannier90.x` executable, Wannier90 is
called directly as a linked library.

In CoQui, Wannierization relies on an existing mean-field (MF) object, which
encodes the Bloch wavefunctions obtained from a prior electronic-structure
calculation. These Bloch states define the single-particle Hilbert space and
form the fundamental basis for the construction of MLWFs.

Requirements:
  - Wannier90 must be compiled with library support and linked against CoQui.
  - A `seedname.win` file must be provided to specify Wannier90 options relevant
    to Wannierization, such as projections, disentanglement windows.
    Crystal structure and k-point metadata are not required, as they are already
    contained in the MF object. See `svo.win` for an example.

Notes:
