def make_mf(mpi, params, mf_type):
    """
    Read a pre-computed mean-field (DFT) solution and construct a CoQuí Mf object.

    CoQuí does not run DFT itself. Instead, it reads the output of an external
    DFT code — selected by ``mf_type`` — and wraps it in a read-only ``Mf`` object
    that subsequent CoQuí steps (interaction construction, MBPT) operate on.

    Supported DFT codes (``mf_type`` values):

    - ``"qe"``    — Quantum ESPRESSO, via the pw2coqui post-processing step
    - ``"pyscf"`` — PySCF
    - ``"bdft"``  — CoQuí's internal mean-field format
    - ``"model"`` — model Hamiltonian (no external DFT code required)

    Parameters
    ----------
    mpi : MpiHandler
        MPI communicator handle obtained from ``coqui.utils.MpiHandler()``.
    mf_type : str
        Selects which DFT code's output to read. One of ``"qe"``, ``"pyscf"``,
        ``"bdft"``, or ``"model"``. 
    params : dict
        File location and read options for the chosen DFT code.
        Keys common to all ``mf_type`` values:

        - ``prefix`` *(str, required)* — file name prefix of the DFT output
        - ``outdir`` *(str, optional, default ``"./"``)*  — directory containing
          the DFT output files.

        Additional keys for each ``mf_type``:

        **"qe"** — reads Quantum ESPRESSO output converted by pw2coqui:

        - ``nbnd`` *(int, optional, default ``-1``)* — number of bands to read;
          ``-1`` reads all bands present in the QE output. 
        - ``ecut`` *(float, optional, default ``0.0``, units: Hartree)* — plane-wave
          kinetic-energy cutoff for the charge-density grid. ``0`` or negative keeps
          the value written by QE; a positive value requests a new FFT grid at that
          cutoff.
        - ``filetype`` *(str, optional, default ``"h5"``)* — input file format.
          ``"h5"`` for pw2coqui HDF5 output (recommended); ``"xml"`` for the legacy
          pw2bgw XML format.

        **"bdft"** — reads a CoQuí BDFT HDF5 file:

        - ``nbnd`` *(int, optional, default ``-1``)* — number of bands to read;
          ``-1`` reads all bands.
        - ``ecut`` *(float, optional, default ``0.0``, units: Hartree)* — same
          semantics as for ``"qe"``.

        **"model"** — reads a model Hamiltonian HDF5 file:

        - ``nbnd`` *(int, optional, default ``-1``)* — number of bands to read;
          ``-1`` reads all bands.

        **"pyscf"** — reads a PySCF HDF5 file; only ``prefix`` and ``outdir`` apply.

    Returns
    -------
    Mf
        A read-only mean-field object that can be passed to interaction and MBPT
        functions such as ``make_thc_coulomb`` and ``run_hf``.

    Examples
    --------
    Quantum ESPRESSO::

        from coqui.utils import MpiHandler
        from coqui.mean_field import make_mf

        mpi = MpiHandler()
        mf = make_mf(mpi,
                     {"prefix": "svo", "outdir": "qe_output/", "nbnd": 40},
                     "qe")

    PySCF::

        mf = make_mf(mpi, {"prefix": "h2o", "outdir": "pyscf_output/"}, "pyscf")
    """
    return Mf(mpi, json.dumps(params), mf_type)
